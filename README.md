[Check out the website here!](#) üåê This project is a part of my continuous exploration of web development, where I delve into advanced techniques and best practices. Trillo combines elegant design with functional features, making it a perfect example of modern web development.

## üåç About the Project

I am **Pratik Agarwalla**, and I built this website as part of my learning journey in web development. Trillo has allowed me to deepen my understanding of:

- **Flexbox Layout:** Mastering CSS Flexbox to create responsive, flexible layouts.
- **Responsive Web Design:** Ensuring that Trillo looks great on any device, from mobile to desktop.
- **SVGs:** Incorporating scalable vector graphics for crisp, clean visuals at any size.

This project was inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's exceptional teaching, which provided the foundation for the design and functionality of Trillo.
